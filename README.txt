Template Activity Module for Moodle
==========================
This is a more modern, and at least for me, more useful template than the others available.
It contains admin and instance settings stubs, a renderer.php and a module.js 

To Use
===========
Replace all instances of tquiz with your module name.
Replace all instances of COPYRIGHTNOTICE with something like "2014 Justin Hunt".
It is recommended to use a search and replace tool from a text editor or a command line script to do this.
Trying to do this manually is sure to lead to mistakes.
Make sure the plugin folder name, and name of the langage file in lang/en, are also changed.

Copy the folder to your [Moodle Site Dir]/mod directory

Install as usual.

Enjoy.

Justin Hunt
